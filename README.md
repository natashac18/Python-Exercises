# Python-Exercises
This projects consists of python solutions to four simple coding challenges, namely the Doubler, Fizz-Buzz, Goodbye and Average-Of-Three.

## Challenges: 

### Doubler
Write a method doubler(numbers) that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array
where every element of the original array is multiplied by 2.

### Fizz-Buzz
Write a method fizz_buzz(max) that takes in a number max and returns an array containing all numbers greater than 0 and less than max that are divisible by either 4 or 6, but not both.

### Average-Of-Three
Write a method average_of_three(num1, num2, num3) that returns the average of three numbers.

### Goodbye
